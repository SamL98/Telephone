AP,N1a ,"A local museum is opening a new modern art exhibit.  The exhibit will be open to all citizens for 2 months in the summer.  The work of a local up and coming artist will be highlighted in the new exhibit.  Some of the pieces in the exhibit contain nudity and strong suggestions of sexual activity.  The museum’s board of directors has solicited feedback from the community regarding the new exhibit.  Some comments have expressed support for the exhibit citing the importance of free speech considerations.  Other comments point out that the exhibit offends their deeply held religious beliefs, and should not be allowed in a public venue.",,
AP,N2a ,"Recently, congress has been debating a newly proposed bill.  The bill would primarily be focused on providing economic assistance to individuals and families who are below or near the federal poverty level.  The bill would cost an estimated 10 billion dollars over the coming six years to fund.  Congressional leaders have been holding a number of town hall meetings to gauge public sentiment towards the new piece of legislation.  One sentiment shared is that minimum wage is no longer a living wage, so such a bill provides necessary aid.  Another sentiment shared at the town hall meetings has been a concern over taxing prosperous citizens to subsidize less ambitious citizens.  ",,
AP,N3a,"A well-known chemical company is seeking to buy a large plot of land from the county.  They are seeking to expand into the region, and would like to build a new plant.  This location is the first choice of the company, but they are looking into other options if they can’t buy this land.  They want to move quickly on the project and have the plant operational by next year.  Some in the community have expressed their support for the purchase, pointing to the jobs and economic growth it would bring.  Others in the community have expressed their support for the purchase, claiming environmental concerns are overblown.",,

CP,N4c,"A new bill is proposed in the state legislature, and is currently being debated.  This bill would allow businesses to decline providing services to customers if doing so would violate their deeply held religious beliefs.  The bill stipulates that businesses would be protected from potential discrimination litigation in such cases.  The bill is nearly identical to other bills that have already been enacted in a number of other states.  Opponents of the bill have argued that it will allow businesses to discriminate against those who hold different lifestyles and views.  Supporters of the bill have argued that without its protections, many business owners must choose between their religion and their livelihood.  ",,

The band they have booked for the concert is known for their strong political views, and occasional use of explicit lyrics.  The amphitheater is located in the center of the city park, and concerts can be seen and heard by those using the park.  The organization has scheduled the concert for a Saturday afternoon in the summer.  Some in the community think that a public space should be equally available to all citizens regardless of views.  Others argue the concert constitutes a disturbance of the peace, and should be cancelled due to its offensive nature.  ",,
CP,N6c,"A large oil company is proposing to begin off-shore drilling operations near a popular bay.  The company believes there are large, untapped reserves of oil beneath the sea floor.  An oil refinery employs many local residents.  The proposed drilling operations would occur ten miles off-shore.  The beaches around the bay are popular tourist destinations.  Swimming, fishing, and boating are common in the bay, which is known for its seafood.  Some in the community fear such drilling would be harmful to sea life and the local environment.  Other local residents think saying no will discourage other business opportunities in the future.  ",,

AS,U1a,"There is currently being research done on an element called thorium, which could potentially replace uranium in the nuclear world. Neutrons that leak out of the fuel region are no longer available to cause fission and must be absorbed by shielding placed around the reactor pressure vessels for that purpose. Dr. Johnson, a nuclear engineer and an expert on thorium supports using thorium to create nuclear power since it is a safer alternative than uranium. Dr. Williams, a biology professor who is not an expert on thorium, also supports using thorium since it is cheaper than using uranium. ",,
AS,U2a,"Since some infections have become antibiotic resistant due to an overuse of antibiotics in society, scientists are looking into the use of phage therapy to attack bacterial infections. Dr. Moore, a molecular epidemiologist and an expert on phage therapy, advocates for phage therapy saying it has been effective in treating bacterial infections in Eastern Europe for many years now. Dr. Wilson, a physicist who is not an expert on phage therapy, also supports phage therapy because phages are much less likely to create a resistant infection since there are so many combinations of phages that can be used.
