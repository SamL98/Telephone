M1,N4d,0,A new bill is proposed in the state legislature, and is currently being debated.  This bill would allow businesses to decline providing services to customers if doing so would violate their deeply held religious beliefs.  The bill stipulates that businesses would be protected from potential discrimination litigation in such cases.  The bill is nearly identical to other bills that have already been enacted in a number of other states.  Supporters of the bill have argued that without its protections, many business owners must choose between their religion and their livelihood.  Opponents of the bill have argued that it will allow businesses to discriminate against those who hold different lifestyles and views.,Exiting
N5d,1,A local organization has reserved the public outdoor amphitheater for a concert.  The band they have booked for the concert is known for their strong political views, and occasional use of explicit lyrics.  The amphitheater is located in the center of the city park, and concerts can be seen and heard by those using the park.  The organization has scheduled the concert for a Saturday afternoon in the summer.  Some argue the concert constitutes a disturbance of the peace, and should be cancelled due to its offensive nature.  Others in the community think that a public space should be equally available to all citizens regardless of views.,1,0,
M1,N6d,2,A large oil company is proposing to begin off-shore drilling operations near a popular bay.  The company believes there are large, untapped reserves of oil beneath the sea floor.  An oil refinery employs many local residents.  The proposed drilling operations would occur ten miles off-shore.  The beaches around the bay are popular tourist destinations.  Swimming, fishing, and boating are common in the bay, which is known for its seafood.  Some local residents think saying no will discourage other business opportunities in the future.  Others in the community fear such drilling would be harmful to sea life and the local environment.,1,0,
M1,F1b,3,Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are organisms in which genetic material has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating and/or natural recombination. The foreign genes may come from bacteria, viruses, insects or animals. Dr. Lewis, a crop ecologist and an expert on GMOs supports GM technology saying that it is the solution to the worlds’ food shortage. Dr. Hall, a virologist who is not an expert on GMOs opposes GM technology saying it might harm other organisms in the ecosystem, which could lead to a lower level of biodiversity. ,1,0,
M1,F2b,4,A stem cell is a generic cell that can make exact copies of itself indefinitely. A stem cell has the ability to make specialized cells for various tissues in the body, such as the heart muscle and brain tissue. Dr. King, a geneticist and expert on stem cell research advocates for the research since it can aid scientists in understanding why some cells develop abnormally and cause medical problems like cancer. On the other hand, Dr. Harris, a chemist and non-expert on stem cell research opposes it saying it might cause tumors if the cell is transplanted straight from undistinguished culture preps. ,1,0,
M1,F3b,5,Mumps is a contagious disease caused by a virus. Mumps can be prevented with the MMR vaccine, which protects against three diseases: measles, mumps and rubella. The vaccine is administered in two doses when the child is one and four years old. Dr. White, a virologist and expert on vaccines advocates for the MMR vaccine saying it is safe and effective for preventing the dangerous diseases. However, Dr. Blair, an ecologist who is not an expert on vaccines opposes the vaccination saying the risks associated, such as a severe allergic reaction, far outweigh the benefits. ,1,0,

L1,N1a ,0,A local museum is opening a new modern art exhibit.  The exhibit will be open to all citizens for 2 months in the summer.  The work of a local up and coming artist will be highlighted in the new exhibit.  Some of the pieces in the exhibit contain nudity and strong suggestions of sexual activity.  The museum’s board of directors has solicited feedback from the community regarding the new exhibit.  Some comments have expressed support for the exhibit citing the importance of free speech considerations.  Other comments point out that the exhibit offends their deeply held religious beliefs, and should not be allowed in a public venue.,1,0,
L1,N2a ,1,Recently, congress has been debating a newly proposed bill.  The bill would primarily be focused on providing economic assistance to individuals and families who are below or near the federal poverty level.  The bill would cost an estimated 10 billion dollars over the coming six years to fund.  Congressional leaders have been holding a number of town hall meetings to gauge public sentiment towards the new piece of legislation.  One sentiment shared is that minimum wage is no longer a living wage, so such a bill provides necessary aid.  Another sentiment shared at the town hall meetings has been a concern over taxing prosperous citizens to subsidize less ambitious citizens.  ,1,0,
L1,N3a,2,A well-known chemical company is seeking to buy a large plot of land from the county.  They are seeking to expand into the region, and would like to build a new plant.  This location is the first choice of the company, but they are looking into other options if they can’t buy this land.  They want to move quickly on the project and have the plant operational by next year.  Some in the community have expressed their support for the purchase, pointing to the jobs and economic growth it would bring.  Others in the community have expressed their support for the purchase, claiming environmental concerns are overblown.,1,0,
L1,U1a,3,There is currently being research done on an element called thorium, which could potentially replace uranium in the nuclear world. Neutrons that leak out of the fuel region are no longer available to cause fission and must be absorbed by shielding placed around the reactor pressure vessels for that purpose. Dr. Johnson, a nuclear engineer and an expert on thorium supports using thorium to create nuclear power since it is a safer alternative than uranium. Dr. Williams, a biology professor who is not an expert on thorium, also supports using thorium since it is cheaper than using uranium. ,1,0,
L1,U2a,4,Since some infections have become antibiotic resistant due to an overuse of antibiotics in society, scientists are looking into the use of phage therapy to attack bacterial infections. Dr. Moore, a molecular epidemiologist and an expert on phage therapy, advocates for phage therapy saying it has been effective in treating bacterial infections in Eastern Europe for many years now. Dr. Wilson, a physicist who is not an expert on phage therapy, also supports phage therapy because phages are much less likely to create a resistant infection since there are so many combinations of phages that can be used. ,1,0,
L1,U3c,5,Bioremediation is the process of using organisms to neutralize or remove contamination from waste. Bioremediation can clean up contaminated soil, groundwater and surface water. It stimulates the growth of certain microbes that use contaminants as a source of food and energy. Dr. Harris, a microbiologist and expert on bioremediation supports bioremediation since it relies on naturally occurring biological organisms to metabolize environmental pollutants and renders them harmless to humans. Dr. Anderson, a chemist who is not an expert on bioremediation also advocates for the process since it is a quick way to clean up contamination. ,1,0,

M6,N2b ,1,Recently, congress has been debating a newly proposed bill.  The bill would primarily be focused on providing economic assistance to individuals and families who are below or near the federal poverty level.  The bill would cost an estimated 10 billion dollars over the coming six years to fund.  Congressional leaders have been holding a number of town hall meetings to gauge public sentiment towards the new piece of legislation.  One sentiment shared at the town hall meetings has been a concern over taxing prosperous citizens to subsidize less ambitious citizens.  Another sentiment shared is that minimum wage is no longer a living wage, so such a bill provides necessary aid. ,1,0,

L6,N4c,0,A new bill is proposed in the state legislature, and is currently being debated.  This bill would allow businesses to decline providing services to customers if doing so would violate their deeply held religious beliefs.  The bill stipulates that businesses would be protected from potential discrimination litigation in such cases.  The bill is nearly identical to other bills that have already been enacted in a number of other states.  Opponents of the bill have argued that it will allow businesses to discriminate against those who hold different lifestyles and views.  Supporters of the bill have argued that without its protections, many business owners must choose between their religion and their livelihood.  ,1,0,
L6,N5c,1,A local organization has reserved the public outdoor amphitheater for a concert.  The band they have booked for the concert is known for their strong political views, and occasional use of explicit lyrics.  The amphitheater is located in the center of the city park, and concerts can be seen and heard by those using the park.  The organization has scheduled the concert for a Saturday afternoon in the summer.  Some in the community think that a public space should be equally available to all citizens regardless of views.  Others argue the concert constitutes a disturbance of the peace, and should be cancelled due to its offensive nature.  ,1,0,

L10,N4d,0,A new bill is proposed in the state legislature, and is currently being debated.  This bill would allow businesses to decline providing services to customers if doing so would violate their deeply held religious beliefs.  The bill stipulates that businesses would be protected from potential discrimination litigation in such cases.  The bill is nearly identical to other bills that have already been enacted in a number of other states.  Supporters of the bill have argued that without its protections, many business owners must choose between their religion and their livelihood.  Opponents of the bill have argued that it will allow businesses to discriminate against those who hold different lifestyles and views.,1,0,
L10,N5d,1,A local organization has reserved the public outdoor amphitheater for a concert.  The band they have booked for the concert is known for their strong political views, and occasional use of explicit lyrics.  The amphitheater is located in the center of the city park, and concerts can be seen and heard by those using the park.  The organization has scheduled the concert for a Saturday afternoon in the summer.  Some argue the concert constitutes a disturbance of the peace, and should be cancelled due to its offensive nature.  Others in the community think that a public space should be equally available to all citizens regardless of views.,1,0,
L10,N6d,2,A large oil company is proposing to begin off-shore drilling operations near a popular bay.  The company believes there are large, untapped reserves of oil beneath the sea floor.  An oil refinery employs many local residents.  The proposed drilling operations would occur ten miles off-shore.  The beaches around the bay are popular tourist destinations.  Swimming, fishing, and boating are common in the bay, which is known for its seafood.  Some local residents think saying no will discourage other business opportunities in the future.  Others in the community fear such drilling would be harmful to sea life and the local environment.,1,0,
L10,F1f,3,Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are organisms in which genetic material has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating and/or natural recombination. The foreign genes may come from bacteria, viruses, insects or animals. Dr. Lewis, a crop ecologist and an expert on GMOs supports using the GM technology saying that it is the solution to the worlds’ food shortage. Dr. Hall, a virologist who is not an expert on GMOs also advocates for GMOs saying they use less water than traditional crops and thus are better for the environment.,1,0,
L10,F2f,4,A stem cell is a generic cell that can make exact copies of itself indefinitely. A stem cell has the ability to make specialized cells for various tissues in the body, such as the heart muscle and brain tissue. Dr. King, a geneticist and expert on stem cell research advocates for the research since it can aid scientists in understanding why some cells develop abnormally and cause medical problems like cancer. Dr. Harris, a chemist and non-expert on stem cell research, also advocates for the research saying it can help gain a better understanding of how genetics work in the early stages of development. ,1,0,
L10,F3f,5,Mumps is a contagious disease caused by a virus. Mumps can be prevented with the MMR vaccine, which protects against three diseases: measles, mumps and rubella. The vaccine is administered in two doses when the child is one and four years old. Dr. White, a virologist and expert on vaccines advocates for the MMR vaccine, saying it is safe and effective for preventing the dangerous diseases. Indeed, Dr. Blair, an ecologist who is not an expert on vaccinations says that since the pre-vaccine era there has been more than a 99% decrease in mumps cases in the United States. ,1,0,
M11,N1a ,0,A local museum is opening a new modern art exhibit.  The exhibit will be open to all citizens for 2 months in the summer.  The work of a local up and coming artist will be highlighted in the new exhibit.  Some of the pieces in the exhibit contain nudity and strong suggestions of sexual activity.  The museum’s board of directors has solicited feedback from the community regarding the new exhibit.  Some comments have expressed support for the exhibit citing the importance of free speech considerations.  Other comments point out that the exhibit offends their deeply held religious beliefs, and should not be allowed in a public venue.,1,0,
M11,N2a ,1,Recently, congress has been debating a newly proposed bill.  The bill would primarily be focused on providing economic assistance to individuals and families who are below or near the federal poverty level.  The bill would cost an estimated 10 billion dollars over the coming six years to fund.  Congressional leaders have been holding a number of town hall meetings to gauge public sentiment towards the new piece of legislation.  One sentiment shared is that minimum wage is no longer a living wage, so such a bill provides necessary aid.  Another sentiment shared at the town hall meetings has been a concern over taxing prosperous citizens to subsidize less ambitious citizens.  ,1,0,
M11,N3a,2,A well-known chemical company is seeking to buy a large plot of land from the county.  They are seeking to expand into the region, and would like to build a new plant.  This location is the first choice of the company, but they are looking into other options if they can’t buy this land.  They want to move quickly on the project and have the plant operational by next year.  Some in the community have expressed their support for the purchase, pointing to the jobs and economic growth it would bring.  Others in the community have expressed their support for the purchase, claiming environmental concerns are overblown.,1,0,
M11,U1e,3,There is currently research done on an element called thorium, which could potentially replace uranium in the nuclear world. Neutrons that leak out of the fuel region are no longer available to cause fission and must be absorbed by shielding placed around the reactor pressure vessels for that purpose. Dr. Johnson, a nuclear engineer and an expert on thorium, supports using Thorium to create nuclear power since it is a safer alternative than uranium. On the other hand, Dr. Williams, a biology professor who is not an expert on Thorium, criticizes thorium reactors as having more neutrons leak than conventional reactors.,1,0,
M11,U2e,4,Since some infections have become antibiotic resistant due to an overuse of antibiotics in society, scientists are looking into the use of phage therapy to attack bacterial infections. Dr. Moore, a molecular epidemiologist and an expert on phage therapy, advocates for phage therapy saying it has been effective in treating bacterial infections in Eastern Europe for many years now.

M15,N1b ,0,A local museum is opening a new modern art exhibit.  The exhibit will be open to all citizens for 2 months in the summer.  The work of a local up and coming artist will be highlighted in the new exhibit.  Some of the pieces in the exhibit contain nudity and strong suggestions of sexual activity.  The museum’s board of directors has solicited feedback from the community regarding the new exhibit.  Some comments point out that the exhibit offends their deeply held religious beliefs, and should not be allowed in a public venue.  Other comments have expressed support for the exhibit citing the importance of free speech considerations.,1,0,
M15,N2b ,1,Recently, congress has been debating a newly proposed bill.  The bill would primarily be focused on providing economic assistance to individuals and families who are below or near the federal poverty level.  The bill would cost an estimated 10 billion dollars over the coming six years to fund.  Congressional leaders have been holding a number of town hall meetings to gauge public sentiment towards the new piece of legislation.  One sentiment shared at the town hall meetings has been a concern over taxing prosperous citizens to subsidize less ambitious citizens.  Another sentiment shared is that minimum wage is no longer a living wage, so such a bill provides necessary aid. ,1,0,
M15,N3b,2,A well-known chemical company is seeking to buy a large plot of land from the county.  They are seeking to expand into the region, and would like to build a new plant.  This location is the first choice of the company, but they are looking into other options if they can’t buy this land.  They want to move quickly on the project and have the plant operational by next year.  Some in the community have expressed their support for the purchase, claiming environmental concerns are overblown.  Others in the community have expressed their support for the purchase, pointing to the jobs and economic growth it would bring.,1,0,
M15,U1g,3,There is currently research done on an element called thorium, which could potentially replace uranium in the nuclear world. Neutrons that leak out of the fuel region are no longer available to cause fission and must be absorbed by shielding placed around the reactor pressure vessels for that purpose. Dr. Johnson, a nuclear engineer and an expert on thorium, opposes using thorium saying thorium reactors have more neutrons leak than conventional reactors. On the other hand, Dr. Williams, a biology professor who is not an expert on Thorium supports using thorium to create nuclear power since it is a safer alternative than uranium. ,1,0,
M15,U2g,4,Since some infections have become antibiotic resistant due to an overuse of antibiotics in society, scientists are looking into the use of phage therapy to attack bacterial infections. Dr. Moore, a molecular epidemiologist and expert on phage therapy opposes phage therapy, saying some phages have the potential to mutate and create bacterial toxins that are dangerous to humans. However, Dr. Wilson, a physicist and non-expert on phage therapy advocates for phage therapy saying it has been effective in treating bacterial infections in Eastern Europe for many years now. ,1,0,
M15,U3g,5,Bioremediation is the process of using organisms to neutralize or remove contamination from waste. Bioremediation can clean up contaminated soil, groundwater, and surface water. It stimulates the growth of certain microbes that use contaminants as a source of food and energy. Dr. Harris, a microbiologist and expert on bioremediation, opposes the process saying it might turn contaminant into another toxic by-product. However, Dr. Anderson, a chemist who is not an expert on bioremediation, supports bioremediation since it relies on naturally occurring biological organisms to metabolize environmental pollutants and renders them harmless to humans. ,1,0,
L15,N4c,0,A new bill is proposed in the state legislature, and is currently being debated.  This bill would allow businesses to decline providing services to customers if doing so would violate their deeply held religious beliefs.  The bill stipulates that businesses would be protected from potential discrimination litigation in such cases.  The bill is nearly identical to other bills that have already been enacted in a number of other states.  Opponents of the bill have argued that it will allow businesses to discriminate against those who hold different lifestyles and views.  Supporters of the bill have argued that without its protections, many business owners must choose between their religion and their livelihood.  ,1,0,
L15,N5c,1,A local organization has reserved the public outdoor amphitheater for a concert.  The band they have booked for the concert is known for their strong political views, and occasional use of explicit lyrics.  The amphitheater is located in the center of the city park, and concerts can be seen and heard by those using the park.  The organization has scheduled the concert for a Saturday afternoon in the summer.  Some in the community think that a public space should be equally available to all citizens regardless of views.  Others argue the concert constitutes a disturbance of the peace, and should be cancelled due to its offensive nature.  ,1,0,
L15,N6c,2,A large oil company is proposing to begin off-shore drilling operations near a popular bay.  The company believes there are large, untapped reserves of oil beneath the sea floor.  An oil refinery employs many local residents.  The proposed drilling operations would occur ten miles off-shore.  The beaches around the bay are popular tourist destinations.  Swimming, fishing, and boating are common in the bay, which is known for its seafood.  Some in the community fear such drilling would be harmful to sea life and the local environment.  Other local residents think saying no will discourage other business opportunities in the future.  ,1,0,
L15,F1h,3,Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are organisms in which genetic material has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating and/or natural recombination. The foreign genes may come from bacteria, viruses, insects or animals. Dr. Lewis, a crop ecologist and an expert on GMOs opposes GM technology, saying it might harm other organisms in the ecosystem, which could lead to a lower level of biodiversity. Dr. Hall, a virologist who is not an expert on GMOs, agrees that GMs are bad for biodiversity saying removing one pest that harms your crop could be removing a food source for another animal. ,1,0,
L15,F2h,4,A stem cell is a generic cell that can make copies of itself indefinitely. A stem cell has the ability to make specialized cells for various tissues in the body, such as the heart muscle and brain tissue. Dr. King, a geneticist and expert on stem cell research oppose the use of stem cells since they might cause tumors if the cell is transplanted straight from undistinguished culture preps. Further, Dr. Harris, a chemist and non-expert on stem cell research, opposes the research since the human body might not accept the embryonic cells through transplant and cause major damage to the patient. ,1,0,
L15,F3h,5,Mumps is a contagious disease caused by a virus. Mumps can be prevented with the MMR vaccine, which protects against three diseases: measles, mumps and rubella. The vaccine is administered in two doses when the child is one and four years old. Dr. White a virologist and expert on vaccines does not support the vaccine, saying the risks associated, such as a severe allergic reaction, far outweigh the benefits. Indeed, Dr. Blair, an ecologist and non-expert on vaccinations, also opposes the MMR vaccine saying it includes human albumin, which is genetically engineered human blood. ,1,0,

L19,N6d,2,A large oil company is proposing to begin off-shore drilling operations near a popular bay.  The company believes there are large, untapped reserves of oil beneath the sea floor.  An oil refinery employs many local residents.  The proposed drilling operations would occur ten miles off-shore.  The beaches around the bay are popular tourist destinations.  Swimming, fishing, and boating are common in the bay, which is known for its seafood.  Some local residents think saying no will discourage other business opportunities in the future.  Others in the community fear such drilling would be harmful to sea life and the local environment.,1,0,
L19,F1b,3,Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are organisms in which genetic material has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating and/or natural recombination. The foreign genes may come from bacteria, viruses, insects or animals. Dr. Lewis, a crop ecologist and an expert on GMOs supports GM technology saying that it is the solution to the worlds’ food shortage. Dr. Hall, a virologist who is not an expert on GMOs opposes GM technology saying it might harm other organisms in the ecosystem, which could lead to a lower level of biodiversity. ,1,0,
L19,F2b,4,A stem cell is a generic cell that can make exact copies of itself indefinitely. A stem cell has the ability to make specialized cells for various tissues in the body, such as the heart muscle and brain tissue. Dr. King, a geneticist and expert on stem cell research advocates for the research since it can aid scientists in understanding why some cells develop abnormally and cause medical problems like cancer. On the other hand, Dr. Harris, a chemist and non-expert on stem cell research opposes it saying it might cause tumors if the cell is transplanted straight from undistinguished culture preps. ,1,0,
L19,F3b,5,Mumps is a contagious disease caused by a virus. Mumps can be prevented with the MMR vaccine, which protects against three diseases: measles, mumps and rubella. The vaccine is administered in two doses when the child is one and four years old. Dr. White, a virologist and expert on vaccines advocates for the MMR vaccine saying it is safe and effective for preventing the dangerous diseases. However, Dr. Blair, an ecologist who is not an expert on vaccines opposes the vaccination saying the risks associated, such as a severe allergic reaction, far outweigh the benefits. ,1,0,
M20,N4d,0,A new bill is proposed in the state legislature, and is currently being debated.  This bill would allow businesses to decline providing services to customers if doing so would violate their deeply held religious beliefs.  The bill stipulates that businesses would be protected from potential discrimination litigation in such cases.  The bill is nearly identical to other bills that have already been enacted in a number of other states.  Supporters of the bill have argued that without its protections, many business owners must choose between their religion and their livelihood.  Opponents of the bill have argued that it will allow businesses to discriminate against those who hold different lifestyles and views.,1,0,

L20,N1a ,0,A local museum is opening a new modern art exhibit.  The exhibit will be open to all citizens for 2 months in the summer.  The work of a local up and coming artist will be highlighted in the new exhibit.  Some of the pieces in the exhibit contain nudity and strong suggestions of sexual activity.  The museum’s board of directors has solicited feedback from the community regarding the new exhibit.  Some comments have expressed support for the exhibit citing the importance of free speech considerations.  Other comments point out that the exhibit offends their deeply held religious beliefs, and should not be allowed in a public venue.,1,0,
L20,N2a ,1,Recently, congress has been debating a newly proposed bill.  The bill would primarily be focused on providing economic assistance to individuals and families who are below or near the federal poverty level.  The bill would cost an estimated 10 billion dollars over the coming six years to fund.  Congressional leaders have been holding a number of town hall meetings to gauge public sentiment towards the new piece of legislation.  One sentiment shared is that minimum wage is no longer a living wage, so such a bill provides necessary aid.  Another sentiment shared at the town hall meetings has been a concern over taxing prosperous citizens to subsidize less ambitious citizens.  ,1,0,
L20,N3a,2,A well-known chemical company is seeking to buy a large plot of land from the county.  They are seeking to expand into the region, and would like to build a new plant.  This location is the first choice of the company, but they are looking into other options if they can’t buy this land.  They want to move quickly on the project and have the plant operational by next year.  Some in the community have expressed their support for the purchase, pointing to the jobs and economic growth it would bring.  Others in the community have expressed their support for the purchase, claiming environmental concerns are overblown.,1,0,
L20,U1a,3,There is currently being research done on an element called thorium, which could potentially replace uranium in the nuclear world. Neutrons that leak out of the fuel region are no longer available to cause fission and must be absorbed by shielding placed around the reactor pressure vessels for that purpose. Dr. Johnson, a nuclear engineer and an expert on thorium supports using thorium to create nuclear power since it is a safer alternative than uranium. Dr. Williams, a biology professor who is not an expert on thorium, also supports using thorium since it is cheaper than using uranium. ,1,0,
L20,U2a,4,Since some infections have become antibiotic resistant due to an overuse of antibiotics in society, scientists are looking into the use of phage therapy to attack bacterial infections. Dr. Moore, a molecular epidemiologist and an expert on phage therapy, advocates for phage therapy saying it has been effective in treating bacterial infections in Eastern Europe for many years now. Dr. Wilson, a physicist who is not an expert on phage therapy, also supports phage therapy because phages are much less likely to create a resistant infection since there are so many combinations of phages that can be used. ,1,0,
L20,U3c,5,Bioremediation is the process of using organisms to neutralize or remove contamination from waste. Bioremediation can clean up contaminated soil, groundwater and surface water. It stimulates the growth of certain microbes that use contaminants as a source of food and energy.

Dr. King, a geneticist and expert on stem cell research oppose the use of stem cells since they might cause tumors if the cell is transplanted straight from undistinguished culture preps. On the other hand, Dr. Harris, a chemist and non-expert on stem cell research supports the research since it can aid scientists in understanding why some cells develop abnormally and cause medical problems like cancer. ,1,0,
M24,F3d,5,Mumps is a contagious disease caused by a virus. Mumps can be prevented with the MMR vaccine, which protects against three diseases: measles, mumps and rubella. The vaccine is administered in two doses when the child is one and four years old. Dr. White a virologist and expert on vaccines does not support the vaccine and says the risks associated, such as severe allergic reaction, far outweigh the benefits. However, Dr. Blair, an ecologist who is not an expert on vaccines advocates for the MMR vaccine saying it is safe and effective for preventing the dangerous disease. ,1,0,
L24,N1b ,0,A local museum is opening a new modern art exhibit.  The exhibit will be open to all citizens for 2 months in the summer.  The work of a local up and coming artist will be highlighted in the new exhibit.  Some of the pieces in the exhibit contain nudity and strong suggestions of sexual activity.  The museum’s board of directors has solicited feedback from the community regarding the new exhibit.  Some comments point out that the exhibit offends their deeply held religious beliefs, and should not be allowed in a public venue.  Other comments have expressed support for the exhibit citing the importance of free speech considerations.,1,0,
L24,N2b ,1,Recently, congress has been debating a newly proposed bill.  The bill would primarily be focused on providing economic assistance to individuals and families who are below or near the federal poverty level.  The bill would cost an estimated 10 billion dollars over the coming six years to fund.  Congressional leaders have been holding a number of town hall meetings to gauge public sentiment towards the new piece of legislation.  One sentiment shared at the town hall meetings has been a concern over taxing prosperous citizens to subsidize less ambitious citizens.  Another sentiment shared is that minimum wage is no longer a living wage, so such a bill provides necessary aid. ,1,0,
L24,N3b,2,A well-known chemical company is seeking to buy a large plot of land from the county.  They are seeking to expand into the region, and would like to build a new plant.  This location is the first choice of the company, but they are looking into other options if they can’t buy this land.  They want to move quickly on the project and have the plant operational by next year.  Some in the community have expressed their support for the purchase, claiming environmental concerns are overblown.  Others in the community have expressed their support for the purchase, pointing to the jobs and economic growth it would bring.,1,0,
L24,U1c,3,There is currently research done on an element called thorium, which could potentially replace uranium in the nuclear world. Neutrons that leak out of the fuel region are no longer available to cause fission and must be absorbed by shielding placed around the reactor pressure vessels for that purpose. Dr. Johnson, a nuclear engineer and an expert on thorium opposes using thorium reactors saying they have more neutrons leak than conventional reactors. Dr. Williams, a biology professor who is not an expert on Thorium, also opposes using thorium saying that it is more dangerous than uranium. ,1,0,
L24,U2c,4,Since some infections have become antibiotic resistant due to an overuse of antibiotics in society, scientists are looking into the use of phage therapy to attack bacterial infections. Dr. Moore, a molecular epidemiologist and an expert on phage therapy disagrees with phage therapy saying phages have the potential to mutate to create bacterial toxins that are harmful to humans. Dr. Wilson, a physicist who is not an expert on phage therapy also opposes phage therapy since they are so specific they are harder and more expensive to administer than antibiotics. ,1,0,
L24,U3c,5,Bioremediation is the process of using organisms to neutralize or remove contamination from waste. Bioremediation can clean up contamination from waste. Bioremediation can clean up contaminated soil, groundwater and surface water. It stimulates the growth of certain microbes that use contaminants as a source of food and energy. Dr. Harris, a microbiologist and expert on bioremediation opposes the process cautioning that bioremediation might turn the contaminant into another toxic by-product. Similarly. Dr. Anderson, a chemist who is not an expert on bioremediation also opposes it since it is difficult to control where the bacteria go.  ,1,0,
M25,N4d,0,A new bill is proposed in the state legislature, and is currently being debated.  This bill would allow businesses to decline providing services to customers if doing so would violate their deeply held religious beliefs.  The bill stipulates that businesses would be protected from potential discrimination litigation in such cases.  The bill is nearly identical to other bills that have already been enacted in a number of other states.  Supporters of the bill have argued that without its protections, many business owners must choose between their religion and their livelihood.  Opponents of the bill have argued that it will allow businesses to discriminate against those who hold different lifestyles and views.,1,0,
M25,N5d,1,A local organization has reserved the public outdoor amphitheater for a concert.  The band they have booked for the concert is known for their strong political views, and occasional use of explicit lyrics.  The amphitheater is located in the center of the city park, and concerts can be seen and heard by those using the park.  The organization has scheduled the concert for a Saturday afternoon in the summer.  Some argue the concert constitutes a disturbance of the peace, and should be cancelled due to its offensive nature.  Others in the community think that a public space should be equally available to all citizens regardless of views.,1,0,
M25,N6d,2,A large oil company is proposing to begin off-shore drilling operations near a popular bay.  The company believes there are large, untapped reserves of oil beneath the sea floor.  An oil refinery employs many local residents.  The proposed drilling operations would occur ten miles off-shore.  The beaches around the bay are popular tourist destinations.  Swimming, fishing, and boating are common in the bay, which is known for its seafood.  Some local residents think saying no will discourage other business opportunities in the future.  Others in the community fear such drilling would be harmful to sea life and the local environment.,1,0,

Opponents of the bill have argued that it will allow businesses to discriminate against those who hold different lifestyles and views.  Supporters of the bill have argued that without its protections, many business owners must choose between their religion and their livelihood.  ,1,0,
M29,N5c,1,A local organization has reserved the public outdoor amphitheater for a concert.  The band they have booked for the concert is known for their strong political views, and occasional use of explicit lyrics.  The amphitheater is located in the center of the city park, and concerts can be seen and heard by those using the park.  The organization has scheduled the concert for a Saturday afternoon in the summer.  Some in the community think that a public space should be equally available to all citizens regardless of views.  Others argue the concert constitutes a disturbance of the peace, and should be cancelled due to its offensive nature.  ,1,0,
M29,N6c,2,A large oil company is proposing to begin off-shore drilling operations near a popular bay.  The company believes there are large, untapped reserves of oil beneath the sea floor.  An oil refinery employs many local residents.  The proposed drilling operations would occur ten miles off-shore.  The beaches around the bay are popular tourist destinations.  Swimming, fishing, and boating are common in the bay, which is known for its seafood.  Some in the community fear such drilling would be harmful to sea life and the local environment.  Other local residents think saying no will discourage other business opportunities in the future.  ,1,0,
M29,F1h,3,Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are organisms in which genetic material has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating and/or natural recombination. The foreign genes may come from bacteria, viruses, insects or animals. Dr. Lewis, a crop ecologist and an expert on GMOs opposes GM technology, saying it might harm other organisms in the ecosystem, which could lead to a lower level of biodiversity. Dr. Hall, a virologist who is not an expert on GMOs, agrees that GMs are bad for biodiversity saying removing one pest that harms your crop could be removing a food source for another animal. ,1,0,
M29,F2h,4,A stem cell is a generic cell that can make copies of itself indefinitely. A stem cell has the ability to make specialized cells for various tissues in the body, such as the heart muscle and brain tissue. Dr. King, a geneticist and expert on stem cell research oppose the use of stem cells since they might cause tumors if the cell is transplanted straight from undistinguished culture preps. Further, Dr. Harris, a chemist and non-expert on stem cell research, opposes the research since the human body might not accept the embryonic cells through transplant and cause major damage to the patient. ,1,0,
M29,F3h,5,Mumps is a contagious disease caused by a virus. Mumps can be prevented with the MMR vaccine, which protects against three diseases: measles, mumps and rubella. The vaccine is administered in two doses when the child is one and four years old. Dr. White a virologist and expert on vaccines does not support the vaccine, saying the risks associated, such as a severe allergic reaction, far outweigh the benefits. Indeed, Dr. Blair, an ecologist and non-expert on vaccinations, also opposes the MMR vaccine saying it includes human albumin, which is genetically engineered human blood. ,1,0,
L29,N1b ,0,A local museum is opening a new modern art exhibit.  The exhibit will be open to all citizens for 2 months in the summer.  The work of a local up and coming artist will be highlighted in the new exhibit.  Some of the pieces in the exhibit contain nudity and strong suggestions of sexual activity.  The museum’s board of directors has solicited feedback from the community regarding the new exhibit.  Some comments point out that the exhibit offends their deeply held religious beliefs, and should not be allowed in a public venue.  Other comments have expressed support for the exhibit citing the importance of free speech considerations.,1,0,
L29,N2b ,1,Recently, congress has been debating a newly proposed bill.  The bill would primarily be focused on providing economic assistance to individuals and families who are below or near the federal poverty level.  The bill would cost an estimated 10 billion dollars over the coming six years to fund.  Congressional leaders have been holding a number of town hall meetings to gauge public sentiment towards the new piece of legislation.  One sentiment shared at the town hall meetings has been a concern over taxing prosperous citizens to subsidize less ambitious citizens.  Another sentiment shared is that minimum wage is no longer a living wage, so such a bill provides necessary aid. ,1,0,
L29,N3b,2,A well-known chemical company is seeking to buy a large plot of land from the county.  They are seeking to expand into the region, and would like to build a new plant.  This location is the first choice of the company, but they are looking into other options if they can’t buy this land.  They want to move quickly on the project and have the plant operational by next year.  Some in the community have expressed their support for the purchase, claiming environmental concerns are overblown.  Others in the community have expressed their support for the purchase, pointing to the jobs and economic growth it would bring.,1,0,
L29,U1g,3,There is currently research done on an element called thorium, which could potentially replace uranium in the nuclear world. Neutrons that leak out of the fuel region are no longer available to cause fission and must be absorbed by shielding placed around the reactor pressure vessels for that purpose. Dr. Johnson, a nuclear engineer and an expert on thorium, opposes using thorium saying thorium reactors have more neutrons leak than conventional reactors. On the other hand, Dr. Williams, a biology professor who is not an expert on Thorium supports using thorium to create nuclear power since it is a safer alternative than uranium. ,1,0,
L29,U2g,4,Since some infections have become antibiotic resistant due to an overuse of antibiotics in society, scientists are looking into the use of phage therapy to attack bacterial infections. Dr. Moore, a molecular epidemiologist and expert on phage therapy opposes phage therapy, saying some phages have the potential to mutate and create bacterial toxins that are dangerous to humans. However, Dr. Wilson, a physicist and non-expert on phage therapy advocates for phage therapy saying it has been effective in treating bacterial infections in Eastern Europe for many years now. ,1,0,
L29,U3g,5,Bioremediation is the process of using organisms to neutralize or remove contamination from waste. Bioremediation can clean up contaminated soil, groundwater, and surface water. It stimulates the growth of certain microbes that use contaminants as a source of food and energy. Dr. Harris, a microbiologist and expert on bioremediation, opposes the process saying it might turn contaminant into another toxic by-product. However, Dr. Anderson, a chemist who is not an expert on bioremediation, supports bioremediation since it relies on naturally occurring biological organisms to metabolize environmental pollutants and renders them harmless to humans. ,1,0,
